            In a galaxy far far away, called Tara B,
            a planetary civilisation grew out of the planet - Lengaburu.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was a very old civilisation, but a new disenfranchised one grew 
            in the neighbour planet - Falicornia. It was raised on democratic values,
            much to the chagrin of the imperial Lengaburu. Falicornians elected Al Falcone, 
            as the de facto leader.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Emperor of Lengaburu, King Shan, wasn't amused anymore. He 
            asked the new Republic to bend the knee. But, Lady Al Falcone empowered 
            by her people, stood tall. And was banished and exiled. There had never been 
            a mutiny of such high order. She was exiled for 15 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lady Al Falcone is now in hiding. But, if King Shan can find her before the years 
            are up, she will be exiled for another 15 years...
        </p>
        <p>
            King Shan appointed YOU, to search for her through the Tara System. Don't take it 
            as a recommendation. It is merely an amusement for him, and your team was the most... peripheral. 
            You will not be given infinite resources for this task. Our King is rational, and won't expend 
            resources meant for the people, on a rebel.
        </p>
        <p id='sign-off'>
            LONG LIVE THE KING!
